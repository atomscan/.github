# ATOMScan
ATOMScan is a blockchain explorer created by a team of blockchain and cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Our goal is to make the most transparent,
accessible, fast and intuitive services for the Cosmos ecosystem. 

You can find our explorer on [https://atomscan.com](https://atomscan.com). We also provide directory services for the
Cosmos [chain-registry](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry). You can browse the registry in a simple file listing 
format on [https://proxy.atomscan.com/directory](https://proxy.atomscan.com/directory) or you can view the directory in a more digestible,
formatted version on [https://atomscan.com/directory](https://atomscan.com/directory).

We think that blockchains should be easy to explore and digest for the average person, so that's our mission. You shouldn't need to be a computer
scientist to use a blockchain or to see what's going on.
